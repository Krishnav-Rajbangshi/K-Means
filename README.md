# K-Means
k-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the clustering problems. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters). The main idea is to define k centers, one for each cluster.

## K-Means is applied in

The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data and to find patterns and make better decisions.. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.
